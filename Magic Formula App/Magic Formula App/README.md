## Magic Formula App Configuration

These are the configuration values that you can change.

I suggest to leave them to what they are.

```
{
  "PageSize": "10",
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Server=(localdb)\\mssqllocaldb;Database=MagicFormulaApp;Trusted_Connection=True;"
  }
}
```
